Fibre Core - 50 um diameter
Fibre Cladding - 125 um diameter
Used for short distances.
Cheaper than Single Mode Fibre

Large Core allows multiple modes of light to propagate.
Allows High data to pass as number of light reflections increases.
High Dispersion and attenuation rate over distance

Due to its large core, some of the light rays that make up the digital pulse may travel a 
direct route, whereas others zigzag as they bounce off the cladding. 
These alternate paths cause the different groups of light rays, referred to as modes, 
to arrive separately at the receiving point. The pulse, an aggregate of different modes, 
begins to spread out, losing its well-defined shape. The need to leave spacing between 
pulses to prevent overlapping limits the amount of information that can be sent. 
This type of fiber is best suited for transmission over short distances.
