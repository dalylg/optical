Fibre Core is 9 um
Cladding is 125 um
Used for Longhaul communications.

More expensive than MultiMode Fibre

Single Mode fiber optic cable has a small diametral core that allows only one mode of light to propagate. 
Because of this, the number of light reflections created as the light passes through the core decreases, 
lowering attenuation and creating the ability for the signal to travel further.
