Contains a core in which the refractive index diminishes gradually from the center axis out toward 
the cladding. The higher refractive index at the center makes the light rays moving down the axis 
advance more slowly than those near the cladding. Due to the graded index, light in the core curves 
helically rather than zigzag off the cladding, reducing its travel distance. The shortened path and 
the higher speed allow light at the periphery to arrive at a receiver at about the same time as the 
slow but straight rays in the core axis. The result: digital pulse suffers less dispersion.
